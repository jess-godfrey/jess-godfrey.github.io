title: "Tanaka Contours Map"
---

## Overview

Tanaka contours are a cartographic technique that enhances terrain perception by varying line weight and illumination direction.  
This project explores how Python-generated contours can be styled and refined within ArcGIS Pro to produce a visually expressive terrain map.

## Method

**Tools used**
- Python (contour generation)
- ArcGIS Pro (styling & layout)
- Spatial elevation data

**Workflow**
1. Generate contour lines programmatically
2. Export to GIS-readable format
3. Apply directional illumination and cartographic styling
4. Refine layout for clarity and contrast

## Technical Notes

This workflow separates analytical generation from cartographic design, allowing:
- Reproducibility
- Parameter tuning
- High-quality final layouts
