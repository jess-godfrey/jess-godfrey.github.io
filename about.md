Welcome — I create map-focused data visualisations that combine spatial analysis, Python workflows, and thoughtful cartography.

As a geoscientist, I work with spatial data every day. While geoscience is often reduced to “rocks,” in practice it is the analysis of complex systems evolving through time and space. It sits at the intersection of geographic information science, spatial analysis, and data interpretation — where patterns, relationships, and uncertainty matter just as much as raw measurements.

My work spans a range of applied problems, from identifying suitable locations for pumped hydro and subsurface carbon storage, to assessing underground hydrogen storage, proximity to power infrastructure, and analysing industrial emissions by sector. Across all of these, spatial data is the common language used to explore constraints, test assumptions, and support real-world decisions.

Cartography is where this analysis becomes communicable. A well-designed map is not just a container for data — it is a narrative device. Through visual hierarchy, symbol choice, colour, and composition, maps can guide attention, reveal structure, and tell a clear story without overwhelming the reader.

This portfolio highlights selected projects with a focus on:
- **Visual clarity** — maps that are readable, balanced, and intentional
- **Reproducible methods** — transparent, Python-driven workflows where possible
- **Storytelling through maps** — using cartography to turn analysis into insight


Each project reflects a balance between technical rigour and design — treating maps not only as analytical tools, but as a medium for explanation and exploration.
