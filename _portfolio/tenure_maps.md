## Overview

Tenure maps produced for government reporting are subject to strict regulatory requirements. Titles, coordinate grids, scales, legends, projections, and prescribed contextual features must all be present and clearly legible. While these standards ensure consistency and compliance, they often result in maps that are visually dense, utilitarian, and difficult to read.

In many cases, the cartographic focus extends only as far as meeting the minimum submission criteria. Little consideration is given to hierarchy, balance, or the experience of the reader — particularly for non-technical audiences — beyond simply “showing what is required”.

This project explores how careful cartographic design can significantly improve the clarity and usability of tenure location maps without compromising regulatory compliance. By using transparency, subtle shadows, symbol layer drawing, and controlled layer blending, even heavily constrained maps can communicate more effectively and feel more considered.

Because real tenure maps are frequently confidential or commercially sensitive (and typically only become public after several years), this example uses synthetic tenure data to demonstrate the design approach while preserving the structure and complexity of a real submission map.

Data was downloaded through publically available spatial websites including:

• QSpatial — Queensland Government open spatial data

• GeoResGlobe — Queensland geoscience and resource datasets

## Technical Appendix

Queensland Government Mapping Requirements (Summary)

Location maps submitted as part of tenure, exploration, or activity reporting must:

• Display the relevant resource authority and associated activity or study area at an appropriate contextual scale

• Use a standard base-10 scale (e.g. 1:10,000; 1:250,000; 1:1,000,000)

• Include all mandatory map elements:

  • Title
  
  • Coordinates
  
  • Scale
  
  • Legible legend
  
  • Datum, projection, and zone
  
• Be produced at a sufficient resolution to ensure all features and text remain legible at the displayed scale

Depending on the activity, maps may also be required to show:

• Nearby petroleum wells or bores

• Seismic survey lines (2D) or survey areas (3D)

• Resource authority boundaries

• Permanent infrastructure (processing plants, dams, ponds, etc.)

• Topographic and contextual features, including:

  • Population centres
  
  • Roads and railways
  
  • Access tracks
  
  • Pipelines
  
  • Watercourses

This project demonstrates how these requirements can be met while still applying strong cartographic principles — prioritising clarity, visual hierarchy, and the end-user experience.
