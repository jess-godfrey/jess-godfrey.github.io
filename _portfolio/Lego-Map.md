## Overview

Everybody loves LEGO®, and this project started with a simple question:
what would a real-world landscape look like if it were built from LEGO bricks?

Using ArcGIS Pro, I explored how elevation data could be stylised into a block-based, LEGO-like terrain model. Beyond being visually playful, this approach offers an accessible way to engage people—especially younger audiences—with spatial data, topography, and cartographic concepts.

To test the idea, I created a LEGO-style elevation model of Mount Warning (Wollumbin) in northern New South Wales. Rising approximately 1,159 metres above sea level, Mount Warning is the prominent central remnant of an ancient shield volcano. At its peak, the original volcano is estimated to have stood more than 1,900 metres high, making it an ideal subject for a compact yet expressive elevation model.
